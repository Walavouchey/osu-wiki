:::

pippi, stylised with a lowercase "p", is the mascot of the osu! game mode since June 2008. She also appears in osu!taiko's default skin, where she is known as pippidon. The initial concept art was created by ::{ flag=US }:: [Sarumaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9427), the pippidon sprite was created by ::{ flag=HK }:: [crystalsuicune](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9974), and the current art was designed by ::{ flag=US }:: [Daru](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32480).

In the game, pippi pops out of the side of the screen at every [combo milestone](/wiki/Gameplay/Combo_milestone) and is also seen on the client's crash window. In the [osu!(lazer) client](/wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer), she appears in UI artwork in the account registration screen, as well as the beatmap listing when no search results are found.

On the website, she appears in fan art scattered throughout various pages, such as the top of the [Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) and placeholder error screens.

Outside of osu!, pippi made a cameo appearance in [Yandere Simulator](https://yanderesimulator.com) as an NPC.

Designed by ::{ flag=ID }:: [xiemon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5203667) after being scouted from the [Most Manic Art Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/80) and announced as the official osu!mania mascots on 2020-09-18, Mani and Mari are twins who can't quite stand each other, but are more similar than they'd care to admit.

Mani is something of a maverick, always looking to explore new styles and things, while his sister Mari (formerly known as Maria) is a rigid, classical perfectionist with a penchant for the spotlight. The two get along like oil and water.

:::

Chirou was one of the entries in the osu!taiko mascot design contest. She is very strict and demanding, a perfectionist, and does not like making mistakes — especially in her beats in osu!taiko. But past her strong outlook, if you get to her soft spot, she can be fluffy and cute. She is 14 years old, born on October 25th with blood type AB. She is also 4 feet 11 inches and weighs 100 pounds. Her hobbies include practising drumming, keeping warm in her cape, and collecting gems or rocks. Chirou has made some appearances in various user fanart submissions.

A carefree spirit with a penchant for violence, IRIS was a proud member of the Prism High Student Council, until her role was cut short due to her violent tendencies in managing the student body.

She is extremely competitive when it comes to games, even to the point of throwing violent tantrums whenever she loses. Because of this, she does not have many friends.

| **Created** | 2024 |

:::

Born into a sheltered life under an aristocratic family, Aloiv rejects the burden of their familial expectations by pursuing a passion in music. At the age of just 4, Aloiv became a well respected conductor of the national orchestra, noted for their prodigal abilities in mastering nearly every instrument.

Despite having an abundance of wealth, Aloiv is very particular about how money is spent, thus earning them the Treasurer role of the council.

| **Created** | 2024 |

:::

As the head shrine maiden of her family-owned temple in the city, Bagel is heavily tied to her traditional roots. The mundane life of the temple walls, incense and prayer bells led her to pick up a hobby in modelling as a form of escape, where she quickly gained a substantial following.

Why does she have a cat tail and ears? Well... that's a story for another day.

:::

Being bound to a wheelchair at birth, Mayu developed a keen passion for robotics to work around her limitations, as well as to help others in overcoming theirs. Her genius as the president of the Robotics Club earned the attention of the council, where she's currently its youngest member. Passionate, kind, and well loved by everyone, Mayu is an exemplary member of Prism High's council.

However, rumour has it that a different side of her can be seen when her glasses are off...

| **Design** | HiroChair |
| **Created** | 2024 |

:::

Perfect grades, unmatched athletics and a knack for leadership, Scarlette is the quintessential president of the council. With a tendency of taking things too seriously, she has trouble empathising with others, resulting in being given the nickname of "Red Ice Queen" by the students.

Outside the public eye, Scarlette is extremely devoted to those she cares about, going above and beyond in making sure they are happy. However, when paired with her lack of awareness towards social nuances, this can sometimes result in her trying a little bit too hard.

Taikonator, also known as Taikonator 3000, was one of the entries in the osu!taiko mascot design contest. He has gained some traction as an inside joke and popularity for unknown reasons.

| **Created** | 22 August 2016 |

:::

Tama was one of the younger entrants in the osu!taiko mascot design contest at only age 15 (or is she?), and has a huge passion for taiko drumming. And thunderstorms. And especially festivals, where she snatches up any takoyaki she can find. Always up for the challenge, Tama hides a particularly mysterious past behind her youthful demeanor.
