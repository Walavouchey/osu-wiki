## Raid Battles

Project Prism introduces a *Raid Battle* system, where players cooperate to defeat boss characters by submitting scores on Project Prism's tiebreaker beatmaps!

Each boss character is associated with an original tiebreaker song release each week starting from the Round of 32. An introductory round featuring "I.R.I.S" is available before then.

Worried about the beatmaps being too difficult? Not a problem! All boss character beatmaps will feature a full difficulty mapset, allowing players of all levels to join in the fun!

To make things more interesting, the Raid Battle mechanic also comes with an added character card system, allowing you to equip up to 5 cards for each score submission to multiply your damage against the boss.

Character cards can be obtained via a *gacha* system, meaning players can earn tickets from weekly missions in order to redeem random cards.

And here's the kicker:

**Everyone is eligible to participate, even non-tournament players!**
