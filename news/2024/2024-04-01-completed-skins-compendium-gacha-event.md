Dear circle clickers, drum bashers, fruit catchers and keyboard smashers,

Welcome to the Completed Skins Compendium Gacha Event!

Some of you may have a mild case of lacking skin repertoire, let's fix that! This is a limited-time event where you'll be able to discover new skins in a game-ified way.

Whether you're a seasoned competitor with an utmost optimised skin for tournament play, a returning player seeking a fresh experience or a complete beginner just starting out, there's something in here for everyone.

Read on for a detailed explanation of how this works, or simply jump right in:

## Event details

For a limited time, you'll have the chance to **spend osu!coins in order to discover a random set of skins** (or in [gacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) parlance, "pulling") from the *Completed Skins Compendium*.

Skins are divided into 5 *categories* (some may be in multiple), which should help you in finding skins you may be more interested in:

- Minimalistic
- Eyecandy
- Anime
- Game
- Other

Skins with more *stars* are rarer, but are generally of high acclaim. There are 3 tiers:

- 5 Star
- 4 Star
- 3 Star

Everyone starts out with ![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-04-01-completed-skins-compendium-gacha-event/coin.png) 1,000 osu!coins, and will gain osu!coins both over time as well as by simply interacting with the system. There is no shortage!

The crux, of course, lies in discovering all high-starred skins (or all **1,066 skins** if you're patient enough) and completing the *Completed Skins Compendium*. The [skinship website](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/) will track how many skins you've received and the completion percentage for each tier.

### All 5-star skins

### Pull rates

| Rarity | Count | Rate | Pity\* |
| :-: | --: | --: | --: |
| 5 Star | 17 | 2% | 50 |
| 4 Star | 83 | 10% | 10 |
| 3 Star | 966 | 88% | *N/A* |

\* If you consecutively receive only skins of lower rarity before the pity amount, the next skin will be of the respective rarity or higher, guaranteed.

### Pull costs
