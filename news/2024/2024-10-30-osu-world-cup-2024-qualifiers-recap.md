The greatest osu! tournament of the year has begun, and so have the recaps!

![](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2024/img/owc2024-banner.jpg)

This year's osu! World Cup is set to be the biggest one ever, and it's got off to a good start with this year having the most registrations out of any OWC ever, ending up in a ground-breaking **65** different countries getting to play the Qualifiers. This was enabled by one out of the two rules that were changed this year, which is that the minimum rank required to sign up was lifted from #5,000 to #10,000. The prize pool this year was also doubled to $10,000, further amplifying the will of players to apply and fight not just for the cash prizes, but also the coveted osu! Champion title.

The other rule change relates to the mappools, with the mappooling team opting to lift restrictions from banning more than 1 map from each pool slot (e.g. Hidden, Double Time etc.), allowing teams to completely block a mod from being played. The reasoning behind this is that modern mappools ditched the "slot pooling" meta for a more varied pool, with each map showcasing a different skill, so it didn't make sense to keep this rule in place.

Speaking of the mappool, let's check out what the mappooling team cooked up this week, and later on we'll talk to [chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) and [Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656) about mappooling for Qualifiers at such a high level of play.

![Qualifier mappool table](/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-30-osu-world-cup-2024-qualifiers-recap/mappool.jpg)

The Qualifier pool for the osu! World Cup 2024 featured 11 maps, all custom-made specifically for the tournament. While it was a step-up in difficulty from last year, there were teams who still managed to FC some maps with all 4 players, which just shows that the playing field has been improving just as much, if not more, than the increase in challenge.

Some highlights of the pool include [Crystal Illusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2267934#osu/4829693) by [milr_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4485933) (HR2), a Hard Rock precision map with challenging elements of flow aim and cut streams that was home to one of the most impressive scores in the entirety of the round, being an SS by [decaten](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5645231) of team USA, and [We Are One (Original Vocal Mix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2267993#osu/4829833) by [Aistre](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879380) (DT1), a tricky, extremely fast aim map at a high AR on Double Time, which ended up challenging many players through its unusual patterning reminiscent of an older era.

A final, noteworthy highlight is the return of the osu!mania original [Toromaru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2268007#osu/4829864) through a map done by [Wispy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11106929), slotted in the Hidden pool. The tricky rhythms and structure ended up being quite a challenge in osu!standard as well, as the map was one of the most difficult in the pool by the end of the week, as the statistics suggest.

The biggest challenges are twofold:

1: Trying to make a pool that is at the same time accessible for the lower and middle tier teams, as well as not completely free for the top teams, which is definitely a lot tougher now that the rank range has been expanded. This also has to be taken into account when choosing how to present certain skill sets, trying to make sure that no skill set is completely gated behind another one in such a way as to limit the player base that can reasonably play that map too much. The same thing doesn't have to happen in later stages, not only due to the increase in the skill level of the lower end, but also because you have more map slots to work with, and split those skill sets up. Which brings us to:

2: Balancing skill set distribution over a smaller pool format â€” the pools over the course of the tournament have free mod slots, and generally have more maps per mod pool (or at least will, eventually). With less total maps comes less possibilities to distribute the map niches we want to test, which means sometimes we have to clump skill sets together on some maps, like [Deorbit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2268007#osu/4829864) or [Crystal Illusion](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2267934#osu/4829693) this year. Furthermore, some skill sets are basically incompatible with either the other niches or with mod pools in general, which limits our options even further. It's a delicate balance of trying to do as much as possible while not throwing everything off-kilter.

Doing all of that while managing a full-custom qualifier pool, which means we have limited control of how difficult maps are in relation to each other, and how much the niche we want them to fill is actually expressed to begin with, means that it's all a pretty difficult endeavor. I think we ended up doing a decent job of it, though.

It's common practice in most tournaments to base the qualifier difficulty off of the mid-range stages, and OWC is no exception. The Qualifiers this year are around 7.3*, which is parallel to our current Quarterfinals difficulty. The mid-range scope allows for a general assessment of a team's skill cap and consistency capabilities. It's important to recognise that while seeing your favourite players battle it out on extremely difficult maps may be incredible, we can't forget about consistency being the most vital skill set in tournament gameplay.

As you've probably recognised, OWC has seen a drastic upward shift in difficulty over the last few years. Due to multiple factors like technological development, skill set refinement and overall player growth, the tournament as a whole has gotten much harder (OWC'24 RO32 being comparable to OWC'20 QF). Qualifiers has followed suit alongside the rest of the mappools. As players continue to grow and hone their craft, we'll do our best to continue to match the expectations.

## Qualifier highlights

Qualifiers started off with a bang, already giving the community plenty to discuss. With 65 different countries competing for the top 32 spots, there were many heartbreaks, surprises, and first times.

![Qualifier results table](/wiki/shared/news/2024-10-30-osu-world-cup-2024-qualifiers-recap/results.jpg)

Starting off with the top 3, among the usual suspects lies a newcomer, Australia! Australia has been a very dominant team for many years, landing anywhere between the top 12 and top 5, but this year they look to be stronger than ever, achieving seed #2.

Next to them, we also have two goliaths of the osu! World Cup, the United States and South Korea, getting seeds #3 and #1 respectively. These two teams have been going at each other for two years straight, and even though the United States have managed to keep them off their backs so far, there are rumblings around the community that this year might be different.

When it came to the teams that are considered mainstays of the World Cup such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, etc., there haven't been many changes, with Poland being the only major outlier. To the shock of many, Poland this year did not manage to place not just in the top 3, but not even in the top 10. With many of the veteran World Cup players not participating, it looks like it's time for the new generation to pick up the slack (with [Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2558286) as their mentor) and maybe even restore Poland back to their old glory.

As always, the most hype overall was generated for the teams that teetered on the edge of 32nd seed, the underdogs such as Belarus, Peru, Uruguay, Italy, etc., all eager to represent their country and show what they are made of.

There were also teams that managed to qualify for the first time ever and try their hand at participating on the World Cup stage. Congratulations to Serbia, Macau, Ireland, Georgia, the Dominican Republic and Bosnia and Herzegovina, because even though they may have not placed this year, they show much potential for improvement.
