With only **15** votes to distribute over **110** entries, it's no secret that choosing the finalists has been a tough nut to crack. But alas, the community has spoken, and now we have our latest batch of Spring 2024 seasonal backgrounds for all to behold and admire here and in the game's main menu!

Enough waiting, let's go through each winning entry in order:

.osu-md__paragraph img {
    aspect-ratio: 5;
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
    animation: parallax linear;
    animation-timeline: view();
}

@keyframes parallax {
    0% {
        object-position: 50% calc(var(--pos) + 15%);
    }
    100% {
        object-position: 50% calc(var(--pos) - 15%);
    }

</div>

Taking first place by a sizeable margin, [**Tofumang**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4817223)'s stunning depiction of pippi relaxing in a field of tall grass and enjoying flowers from a more appropriate vantage point, much like the pink butterflies keeping her company, captivated **2203** voters who decided to appreciate this particular moment alongside her.

<div style="--pos: 30%;">

</div>

**1915** voters agreed with the vibes of [**KAITO thighs**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13103233)' (better known as *Dreamxiety*) playful rendition of a catgirl pippi experiencing direct contact with a field of anemones.

By voting on this entry, they've also agreed to play osu!catch. Friends, it is on your honour to uphold your end of this one.

</div>

**1855** onlookers took the invitation by [**LeeNarie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2667849) for a picnic with pippi, Aiko, Chirou, Mari and Mocha by the fresh airs of a canal path lined with cherry blossom trees. Don, Taikonator and an oddly familiar cat are there for the ride, too.

</div>

**1833** voters were divided into two groups: those struck by nostalgia upon the sight of "pippi Goku" on a Flying Nimbus along with Mocha, Don and Yuzu in an amazing and unexpected crossover, and those who simply appreciated [**Kwms024**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11516014)'s detailed artwork of a hard-working gardener pippi.

There's probably some overlap between the two.

[**kohiibeans**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34834104)'s chill pippi in a field of white azaleas and a cherry blossom tree resonated with **1424** astute watchers, who we're sure also noticed the *FREEDOM DiVE* orbs and our frequently appearing feline friend.

<div style="--pos: 50%;">

### peppy's Picks

Whenever we're hard at work in the osu! offices preparing the grand reveal of our beloved fanart contests, it has been said that a certain Dean "peppy" Herbert keeps a stark but subtle gaze upon the entries, waiting for that one piece to truly capture his heart to bless it with the almighty power of The Pick™, should the public not give it its deserved justice.

This time, **6** entries have left The Dean in a state of awe, so, we did the one thing that must be done and included them in here!

</div>

[**AyoLie**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29186645) shows us what pippi, Mocha, Mari, Chirou and Aiko are up to while there's some downtime from their studies. What better way to spend it, than to gaze upon flowers and butterflies of all colours!
