Delve into the origins and behind-the-scenes of how a music scene has not-so-quietly taken shape within osu!.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/banner.jpg)

More and more, people have been creating original songs within the osu! community. These works have mostly been created for tournament mappools, proliferating exponentially since around 2020 to 2021.

...What exactly happened to get us here?

This is a story about original songs of the osu! community's creation, and it cannot be told by just one person.

From early beatmaps entirely of bespoke origin, to the outset of the Featured Artist initiative in 2016, to the beginning and increase of osu! originals in World Cups, to the explosive initiative of community tournaments to create *even more* original music, dotted with focused works of passion along the way,

Read on below for a deep dive into how this scene formed and flourished proper in this new decade.

But first...

## What are osu! originals?

The songs we're talking about fall under the umbrella of "osu! originals", a term we use to describe any song that was made specifically for or first debuted in osu!. Be it for an event, tournament, a song made for a particular beatmap — if it originated within osu!, that is an osu! original.

It means that osu! originals don't only refer to songs commissioned by the osu! team, such as for the World Cups. Any song created for the community qualifies. Whenever such songs are made by Featured Artists and displayed in their FA pages (and thus licensed by the osu! team), they are marked with a pink "osu! original" label.

A comprehensive listing of such songs can be found in the [osu! originals wiki article](/wiki/osu!_originals).

## osu! World Cups

The osu! team organises [World Cups](/wiki/Tournaments#official-world-cups), which since osu! World Cup 2020 started incorporating original music into tiebreaker beatmaps. Have a listen to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)'s discussion about all of that and how this operation expanded in scope over the years.

## Community tournaments

### Global Taiko Showdown

Whether it be by coincidental ideas or by the example set by the World Cups, community tournaments sprawled into procuring original music for their tournaments (mostly for Grand Finals tiebreaker beatmaps, literally over 100 of them).

A whopping **32%** of all current tournament originals in osu! originate from the [Global Taiko Showdown](https://gtsosu.com/) series. We have in large part [**Kasumi-sama**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263) to thank for that.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/Kasumi-sama.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263)

> Hello! I am mainly known on osu! as [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263), with my general username being Kasumi. I have been an all-modes osu! player from 2015 to 2023, and I am mainly known as a tournament organizer since 2018, mainly for the Global Taiko Showdown tournament series, as well as having helped as an administrator for [osu!frlive](https://www.twitch.tv/osufrlive)'s French tournaments from 2019 to 2022. I've also helped out in the Project Loved as an osu!catch captain in the past, as well as having been a member of the [Tournament Committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee).

What eventually became a titan of music production splashed into the music scene early in 2021, just a year into its life yet having hosted 4 osu!taiko tournaments in a full spectrum of difficulty tiers. Global Taiko Showdown took the lead to twist an inflection point in osu!'s life into unimaginable heights.

The question is, how and why did it happen in the first place?

> The answer to that is actually, like most things in GTS, pretty surprisingly simple HAHA. On November 28th 2020, [Sparxe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5750235), being one of the composers we've worked with very often since then, DM'd me to ask if GTS had ever thought about incorporating some sort of sound design for it at all. After some discussion with designers, we had decided to have a specific music playing for countdowns of our upcoming tournament, being CGTS 2021, which started in January 2021.
> 
> Then on January 3rd, I offered Sparxe to work on that tournament's 4v4 phase's Grand Finals tiebreaker, which would be known as [Chicxulub](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1429738), the first ever GTS original.
> 
> If you asked me WHY specifically we asked for a tiebreaker, quite frankly, reading my past messages, I have no idea either. Although, if I had to say, it was probably just myself seeing World Cups start implementing in their respective Grand Finals tiebreaker for each mode, and thinking we could do that for each GTS tournament, but thinking we could do better nonetheless, and it's what we've been striving for ever since then.

And deliver they did; if the World Cup could do it, they could do it too. GTS continued to produce original Grand Finals tiebreakers throughout the following months, with [Dz'Xa - COSMOBEAT](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1523659) debuting for [RGTS 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/RGTS_2021), [II-L - Asteroid Field of DECAPLETS](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1563553) for [IGTS 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/IGTS_2021) and [pm04034 - Invenzione No. 3N&3R: Sonatina for a Dying Lord](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569783) for [LGTS 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1381556).

Then something unprecedented happened. Over the winter and into the next year, [Expert Global Taiko Showdown 2021](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2021) saw **11 original tracks**, forever etching GTS indubitably in the highest echelons of prestige and quality of production.

But the momentum never stopped. 24 GTS songs debuted in 2022, [EGTS 2022](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/EGTS_2022) making up 19 of them. [COEGTS 2023](/wiki/Tournaments/GTS/COEGTS_2023) became the first and currently only tournament to feature an entirely original soundtrack of 28 songs.

To date, Global Taiko Showdown has produced **over 70 original songs**, *half of them* being created *just last year*, and for 3 consecutive years, they've been able to release compilation albums. Perhaps while readings the rest of this article, feel free to have a listen to their latest one with the sounds of GTS of 2023.

### osu! Malaysia

The Malaysian tournament scene has seen original music in all game modes, most prominently in osu! Malaysia and osu!taiko Malaysia.

How did their story start? They were asked similar questions as Kasumi, so let's have two of the organisers take it away:

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/Its_not_Marvin.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13600612)

> Hi, my name is Marvin, known as Its not Marvin in osu. I am mainly known to be the host of osu! Malaysia Tournament from 2020 to 2023.
> 
> It all started in 2021 with the previous host of osu! malaysia tournament, Kumaxione, he wanted to do something special for his last year staffing, so he decided on commissioning a custom song with a local composer, takehirotei.
> 
<!--
> 
> The production process on the std end is kinda straightforward, we give takehirotei a theme, desired BPM range and let him cook, he will send us some initial drafts and from there we give him feedback and stuff, until we are satisfied with the final song. Particular things that i look into would mainly be whether the song fits the theme or not, especially in 2023 where it is the last year of a bunch of staff in the std team, including me, i wanted to make sure it was emotional, a proper goodbye sort of thing.
-->
> 
> Every time we present the custom song, the reaction from the players, viewers is always a special moment for me. For std atleast, the planning of the next custom song starts almost immediately after the current iteration of the tournament ends. So to see that everyone is surprised and hyped for the final song and final presentation feels so satisfying, knowing that the time and effort my team and I put in was so worth it.
> 
> Challenges in particular, definitely in 2023, majority of us that volunteer in local tourneys in Malaysia are uni students, so when physical classes restarted, the time and availability that felt like an abundance during the pandemic era is suddenly gone. To be able to plan and run the tourney with the limited time that we had, felt like quite the achievement, as it was exhausting and scary at times, wondering if we can finish things before the deadline of not
> 
> I feel like the taiko side definitely has larger budgets, and may have more sophisticated processes when it comes to the custom songs planning and producing process, as they had a custom song for every round of the osu!taiko Malaysian Tournament 2022, unlike std where we have 1-3 custom songs for the entire tournament

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/Jerry.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/605973)

> Hello! My name is Jerry (or NZMJerry), and I'm mostly known for my design works in a number of osu! tournaments and original tracks such as the [Global Taiko Showdown](https://gtsosu.com/) (GTS) series, [osu! World Cup 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2095177#taiko/4393066) and [Jaye's One Key Event (JOKE)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1829307?n=1). Besides my designing works, I'm also the host of the osu!taiko Malaysian Tournament (OTMT) series as well as several other events ranging from contests to [LANs](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2023-08-22-osu-malaysia-animangaki) for the overall osu! Malaysian community.
> 
> After wrapping up the first edition of the osu!taiko Malaysian Tournament (OTMT) series back in 2021, the team didn't want to just do the same thing again for the next year and beyond, so we felt that the most natural progression for the series' growth was to start introducing original songs into the mix. I truly believe that this, along with the introduction of our mascot character, IRIS, helped a lot in weaving a recognizable visual identity for the whole tournament, which significantly enhanced the tournament experience.

Visual arts go hand in hand with music commissions and tournament production, which is itself an interesting topic (that we may cover in the near future!).

> The music production process for our team is rather straightforward. We'll usually only specify the particular genre and difficulty that we're looking for to an artist based on the style that they're comfortable with, along with some example tracks provided. Besides that, the artists are given creative liberties to elevate it however they wish. I think this process works very well as we also have a general channel for all our composers to mingle and share ideas for each other's works, allowing for more constructive opinions to be provided throughout the process by equally skilled individuals.

<!-- Do you have any fond or interesting memories you'd like to share? Have there been challenges of particular note along the way? -->

<!-- I think a better question would be what _wasn't_ challenging hahaha. -->

> Kicking off the OTMT series back in 2021 felt like I was thrown into the deep end of a pool, with almost none of my past tournament staffing experiences being applicable. Covering every role with the extremely small group of staff that we had was tough, but in hindsight I think that experience was necessary for us to gain insight into what worked and what didn't, which then helped alot in addressing any issues for the 2022 edition.
> 
> Even then, this still did not make OTMT2022 any easier to manage. Production levels were higher, our team grew larger, and expectations were now compounded too with the increased number of eyes on the project (special thanks to [Kasumi-sama](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6177263)). Nevertheless, I think all the countless sleepless nights of work that we poured into the project was all worth it. Having the opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people I've ever met in music composition, character artworks, graphic designing, and many more for the project is perhaps one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had.
> 
> The most significant challenge that we faced during OTMT2022 was, of course, the realistic aspect of hosting these kind of projects — the cost. However, thanks to the insane generosity and support from the community, we managed to fully fund the costs of the tournament solely through community donations. This is something that I'll forever be grateful and proud of, and is also what keeps me motivated to continuously find new ways to up the scale for this series :)

<!-- > Also while we're on the subject of "upping the scales", do be on the lookout for the next edition of our osu!taiko Malaysian Tournament series, OTMT2024 coming in early April. I can wholeheartedly promise that it will be a brand new experience that has never been seen before in the osu! tournament scene. -->

---

The Malaysian tournaments collectively have 19 original tracks in total at the moment, but word is on the street that more is on the way!

## Inside the music pipeline

While mangomizer and pishifat touched on the process of World Cup music production, how does it fare for other tournaments? **Kasumi** had this to say:

> The production process in GTS is very largely hands-off from us as admins. It all depends on the slot we shoot for, but for tiebreakers for example, we usually just give a general rundown of the structure we'd like, as well as a specific atmosphere we're shooting for. At that point, everything like genre, BPM and length, are basically decided by the artist's wish.
> 
> We only ask for relatively frequent drafts, in intervals of 30 seconds to 1 minute, so we can check if we first like the general vibe, as one would expect, and if we can map it accordingly to the planned difficulty, of course.<!-- In terms of particular things we look for in compositions themselves, I don't think we search too deeply for one specific thing, it's just about what we like, and then trying to branch out to work with as many different artists as we can, to just have a fun work experience with everyone involved, really. -->

The other tournament hosts interviewed here said basically the same thing, which means there's only one thing to do.

Let's have a look straight at the source.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/takehirotei.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794)

> Hey there, I'm [takehirotei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794), just your normal rhythm gamer that composes music as a side job. If you're from osu!, you might have heard of me from some tiebreaker songs from some tourneys such as osu! (and taiko) Malaysia Tournaments, EGTS, or 4DMWC 2023 and many more, or if you're outside osu!, you might even heard me as the anime song remix guy for remixing some popular titles such as *Idol* (under the Imaginary Reality alias) or *Guitar*, *Loneliness* and *Blue Planet*.

<!-- First of all, I would like to give a shoutout to osu! Malaysia Tournament for giving me an opportunity to make a custom grand finals tiebreaker for them at 2021. Then shortly after the tiebreaker is released, other tournaments like GTS started to contact me to make a tiebreaker song for them, and soon enough, many other tournament host starting to contact me and here I am.
I would also like to give a shoutout to Team Incoherent Sound for giving me an opportunity to take part on A Labour of Love contest, as this is the reason why osu! Malaysia Tournament contacted me at the first place. -->

[**takehirotei**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794) has produced over 20 songs for various community tournaments, 6 of them being for Global Taiko Showdown. Here's their perspective on how it all goes down:

> For the production process, the host will set a deadline on the song, as well as some restrictions on the song (e.g. BPM limit, intensity, genres and more) in order to make sure the song will fit nicely to the planned (or not planned) slots. From time to time, we sometimes also send wips of the current state of the song to make sure that the song is going to the correct direction. This will ensures that we dont have to do unnessary changes later on when the full song is done, which can saves us a lot of time.
> 
> [...] sometimes when a part in the song needs modifications, the host will give some comments on how to fix the issues on the said part. For example, extending certain instrument length, reducing the volume of certain instruments, reduce the spam kicks and etc.

Having experienced working with around 10 different tournament series, are there any differences?

> I'd say not too different. The only difference I'd say is how the host handles the procedure.<!-- Generally, we will be ask if we are down to make a song for a tournament, then we are given the details of how the song would go, then we start cooking it and send wips to them. --> [...] What's different is sometimes, the host might add you into the mapping channel, so that when the mapper has any questions for the composer, the composer can help them with it (e.g. "what snappings are in this part?", "what is the time signature for this part?" and so on). <!-- But yeah, this is the general process of how a custom song is made in community tournaments. -->
> 
> One of the challenge that I've faced in making songs for osu! tournaments is to do a bit of research on the style the host is going to put me into. As there are many. For example, let's say if the host wants the song to be in DT1 slot for osu!taiko, then I need to do a bit of research on the songs that are usually used in that slot.
> 
> But if I'm lucky, sometimes the host will list down a long list of description on how the song will goes (thanks Kasumi), this will really help us composers to work on the correct direction. Another challenge that I'm facing while making songs for tournaments (or rhythm games in general) is that these kind of songs usually doesnt have much chill parts, which sometimes it's a little bit challenging to make a song with most of the parts are intense parts.

Regarding organisers giving detailed directions, mangomizer explained in the video mentioned in the beginning that this is something the World Cups did initally, but moved away from due to it resulting in less cohesive songs.

Whether to give more creative freedom to the artist or to prompt them with more detail in order to fit mappooling restrictions is an interesting question. takehirotei expanded on this a bit.

> For prompting style, sometimes it can really help me to explore the paths that I have never gone before in composing (e.g. trying out new genres), which is something that I really like to do. However, if I'm unable to follow the prompt, usually I'll also give a proposal on how I'll do the song while following parts of the prompt that I'm able to follow, so that the host/mappooler can move me to an appropriate slot or do necessary changes.
> 
> But of course, sometimes the hosts also gives me the freedom to do whatever I want (e.g. [Finale Battle of the Requiem](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1524502)). This definitely could result in more freedom in composing, as well as the freedom to explore some composing techniques (e.g. usage of polyrhythm, microtonal, etc.)
> 
> So I'd say, both styles work well for me, as they have their own challenges and exploration.

It may be a question affected by highly individual factors from the composition, organisation and mappooling sides, as well as different perspectives and expectations for the songs themselves. We'll leave that to future organisers to think about.

<!--
> For C://YOU NEX-TIME, I was asked to make something that's a bit sadge as 2023 is the last year the current host will be hosting osu! Malaysia Tournament. Originally, it's just an instrumental song without vocals, until I have found out the existence of SynthV, then I decided to take a shot on making lyrics to make it even more emotional.
> 
> As for The Everlasting Star of Yearning, I tried to visualize the atmosphere to be someone trying to climb to the top from the bottom of abyss, which explains why the song started from slow and dark, to something fast paced and hopeful at the end.
> 
> And for Global Disco Showdown, Kasumi was looking for someone who can do that slot that time, so I challenged myself to do something out of my comfort zone, which is a Disco genre. I took a lot of inspirations from YO-KAI Disco, and try to use my approach to make simillar style, with some modern twist. And to make it sounds even more nostalgic, I've toned down the entire song by 50 cents, so that it gives it out a strong retro vibes while still sounding modern.

> Extra: Btw stay tuned for osu! Taiko Malaysian Tournament 2024 (which is opening for all South East Asian Countries!!!), I've seen what the production team cooks and the production quality is really insane, I'm sure y'all will like it too :D

> There are many interesting memories I would like to share, but today I will be sharing one of the memories that has left a lot of impact in my heart. The first one is during the process of making Essence with HowToPlayLN. This is my first time collaborating with someone (as in 2 ppl collab) on making a Grand Finals tiebreaker. At first, we are just trying to put in the tiebreaker copypasta into a tiebreaker song,  but as time goes by, our ideas become crazier and crazier. At one point we even decide madke a section where the time signature changes every bar. After the tiebreaker was made, things got even more crazier as the media team is cooking the lore. At first we only have the tiebreaker, then soon enough, we all decide to make a song for each cutscenes that shows before the mappool showcase begins, and also a rearrangement of Essence for the credits theme. This is perhaps the most precious memories that I have ever been through at that point as a composer.
-->

<!--
> For me, I don't really have a work that I'm less happy with, although my older works like the songs before 2022 have pretty bad mixing done, but all the songs I've made serves a memory in my heart, so I'm not dissatisfied on any of the songs that I've made.
> As for works that I'm particularly happy with, I'd say Essence, I.R.I.S, C://YOU NEX-TIME and also an upcoming custom song for OTMT2024. These songs have teaches me so many technique in composing (e.g. Lyrics writing, irregular time signature writing, composing certain genres and etc).
> For works that the reception has surprised me the most is probably gonna be Fullest Adventure from the Abyss to Divine. For this song, I've almost never used any reference song to make it (which I usually did on my other songs), which at first I'm actually pretty worried will people like this kind of song or not. But it turns out, people actually like it and the song somehow even got blew up in other communities like ADOFAI
-->

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/HowToPlayLN.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600)

> Hi! My name is HowToPlayLN, in-game you can call me LN or index. You may know me as an ex-osu!mania mapper (especially [polyriddim](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182702)), ex-mwc player 2019-2022, did some statistics and data science and made storyboards for some tournaments and now a composer. Meanwhile in real life I am doing coding and data science stuff.

Like takehirotei, [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600) also has composed over 20 songs across a multitude of tournaments. Of course, the first thing to ask is *"how did it all start?"*.

> If we're talking on how I started doing music, it would throwback to my first composition which I also mapped it and named it after myself ([HowToPlayLN - HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1602222#mania/3271953)). I think at some point some people were also joking with myself about "HowToPlayLN custom song when". Then... it's just that I decided to do one for an achievement that I would basically just be a jack-of-all-trades for a tournament scene in osu!mania or osu! in general.

<!--
> My first tournament was actually DDS Tournament for which I offered a piano custom song, and then I decided to participate in osu!taiko Malaysia Tournament with my first tiebreaker custom song alongside with takehirotei's custom remix of my song being presented in osu!mania LN Tournament 3 (Normal Distribution Remix), and I decided to develop the lore to go along with it and another custom song (for those who are interested, see [LNCryption](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1893946)) which was the reason I continued to do the custom songs in the tournament scenes.
-->

<!--
> I actually see music as something I would do for fun or as a hobby, but I still open myself to experimenting new things, or expressing my emotions. I feel like doing custom songs sometimes can be the place to put my emotions on through the story that my peers and I created. I feel like when I create or listen, I hear the music, but when I feel down or depressed, the music hears me back.

> I can still find LNCryption (from osu!mania LN Tournament 3) and Essence (from 4 Digit MWC 2023) being prequel-sequel to each other being relatable to me in real life. As the time goes, there's still the way to develop the lore and the universe forward from that. Of course there's going to be another project to continue what was left off, and hopefully there will be more experimental approaches to creating harmonies and rhythms.
-->

> For me, it would be between the composer(s) and the mappers to discuss about the base information of how the song should be, like whether snap divisions on this bpm is suitable to map in this difficulty before shaping my own ideas. I would also consider the song name, the background story and sometimes I would actually encourage the mappers to try feedback or mapping the demo to determine whether it is alright for the given difficulty.
> 
> The ideas are... randomly come to me, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, but as long as there's a theme for it everything can continue smoothly. Mostly for the tiebreakers, there are at most 2-4 themes (or what we called "motif") for the song, representing each "mood" or side of the stories, each theme will get developed, and getting each turn to shine in their own part.
> 
> For other composers who may or may not play osu! or rhythm game in general, I think the communication is also challenging between mappers and composers. All I want to say is please do not be hesitate to stay connected to each other! For osu!mania or taiko it can be potentially more straightforward because they can be mapped to other rhythm games easily, but for other modes, it is okay to give the direct feedback and opinions on how this can be charted, these would help composers a lot in decision making of how to progress the song further.

> Having a lore or story sometimes would help us as well! It would shape us ideas on how the emotions or the atmosphere should be in the song, and when and how to make the "chaos" or "resolve" in the song given the bpm and difficulty constraints. At least it helps with creativity a lot!

**Are there challenges in making songs for osu! events compared to your other works?**

> The challenging part is actually how to maintain the rhythm difficulties while having the stories in mind. There needs to be some balances between these twos. For example in my perspective, I want to make something that is not just music, it has to be something that is meaningful and worth experiencing. So I am quite perfectionistic towards my own work that it needs to show something in me, or sometimes there's another challenge on my own self-esteem when I felt like I didn't use enough advanced techniques in my work, or sometimes I came up with the ideas and then scrapped it later due to insufficient ideas on continuation to that idea.

**I understand you have worked with a variety of tournaments, such as osu!(taiko, mania) Malaysia tournaments, Global Taiko Showdown and the (4 Digit) osu!mania World Cups. Are there differences in music production between them, such as in process, expectations or otherwise?**

> For these tournaments, I think the thing that was having in common is at first we used spreadsheet for planning, but in reality it's just... whatever works, but hey! Can't complain since we often get more innovative and out-of-the-box from what's written in the paper! For example, 4 Digit osu!mania World Cup, we completely went out of what we planned at first in the 2nd Half, or Akatsuki (GTMS) where it was just completely a different approach from the sheet altogether. OTMT and OMMT actually had the different gimmicks, that I focused more on the experimentation and challenged myself to make something that is musically innovative and challenging to map at the same time.

> It's also the matter of domain knowledge also about how to come up with the ideas, different modes actually have the different requirements for the songs. For osu!mania I often get more comfortable to be experimental with polyrhythms because it is required to be something to address the technicality in the higher level difficulties. But I found the thing in common between these two modes is to have the sufficient section with 16th notes (1/4 snaps) for stamina and/or long note elements. But also it is pretty relaxed to mix between them for more flavors!

> Additionally, Essence became an album on how the motif or theme can be extended belong side with the [stories](https://4digitmwc.github.io/media-centre/stories/infinity), which also was the link between the previous iteration of the tournament and LNCryption. As we finished the tiebreaker song, we continued to expand the ideas of Essence being some kind of events in the story and built the stories with them. So each section of Essence can be interpreted as the throwback and the resolution of the story.

## Collaborations

Cool things can happen when people work together. That's also true for artists — there are plenty of songs in osu! composed by multiple people.

How exactly does this work? HowToPlayLN and takehirotei have composed songs together before.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2024-01-16-bespoke-music-in-osu/takehirotei.png)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11793794)

> For collabrations, let's say we have n composers, we usually split the song into n parts, where each composers focus on that particular part (unless there are composers who want's to collaborate with another composers for their part).
> 
> We also sometimes planned the whole song out in a Google Sheet first before composing the real thing. For example, in [GTS Orchestra Team - Akatsuki - Tokoyami no Yoru ga Aketa Toki -](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1988498), in the beginning, we all decided to go for a "SEGA sound team chunithm boss song" kind of song, then we decide the order of SiLiS doing the front part, HowToPlayLN and rN do the middle part, and I do the final part.

> 
> But of course, the sheet you're seeing now is not what we have planned at the beginning, as more progress are made, we sometimes needed to change the flow a bit in order to "fit the flow", and sometimes there are also times where some composers (including myself) are busy at irl activities, so we sometimes let the other composers do their part first, then only go back to the original composer to connect the previous part and the next part together.
> 
> But of course, this is not the only method to collaborate. Another method that I've known is one composer in charge of composing most of the structure of the song, then another composer would do the instrumentation of it. So this way, both the composers signature style would be presented at the same time without much clashing. For example, in [Essence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1943786), HowToPlayLN did most of the composition and planning on the song, as well as some instrumentations, while I do the rest of the instrumentation, mixing and mastering on the song.

<!-- **How do collaborations usually work? For example, for songs like** _GTS Orchestra Team - Akatsuki - Tokoyami no Yoru ga Aketa Toki -_ **or** _takehirotei vs. HowToPlayLN - Essence_. -->

> For collabs, I mostly become more of a melody person. Like *Akatsuki*, I was more in charge of the middle part and SiLiS and takehirotei was in charge of extending the idea from left to right while rN was in charge of adding dynamics to my orchestra. We often planned beforehand what to do after the initiative was done, it's important to have the "theme" to the song for us first before deciding how we develop them, and that's how we create the collaborations in the workflow perspective.
> 
> Mostly my part of the collaboration would be stored in MIDI before adjusting dynamics. For the gluing parts together, mixing and mastering, mostly other artists who are more specialized will do the work. So big appreciation for them for handling all of these actually.

## A chaotic path of memories

Passion often comes with trials, and the most ambitious projects have by no means been easy achievements.

> [...] I think the story behind COEGTS' Main Mappool Showcase and it getting finalized, like, at all, is one of my absolute favorite experiences as the main organizer of GTS.
> 
> First off, I believe everything related to creating this mappool showcase starts on July 10th 2023, being one day after our Qualifiers Mappool Showcase was released, and three weeks prior to the actual mappool showcase at COE, on July 31st.
> 
> At that point, we had most songs ready to go, except one was not given by the composer yet, and the tiebreaker had just gotten finalized that very day. 7 out of the 16 songs had an artwork for it made at all, and 2 of them had their video ready. Of course, lore was not even remotely created. As you can see, setting ourselves up for success here.
> 
> The design channel then turned into an absolute warzone for the next 21 days, with designers, especially Transendium who has worked on 8 of these songs alone, managing to keep finalizing a few artworks here and there every day, even if some days were empty, due to them also working on other tournaments.
> 
> We had gotten our last song for it to be mapped and make its video finalized on.. July 20th.
> 
> Fast forwarding again, we arrive at July 27th, where both of us admins, being myself and [TaikoMom](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9086438), along with every single designer for GTS, our main voice actress for our female characters being [Ethereal_Winter](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9780417), and some of our composers who were working on the lore part of things, being [blobdash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8337877) (for BGM), and NormalM (as a voice actor), literally stayed in VC for the next 4 days right up to the showcase day, where we kept rotating between everyone passing out at some point, but generally working on finalizing the design and videos for songs, writing the entire lore, recording all voicelines for lore between July 29th to July 30th, where I was forced to stay up until 9am to record voicelines LOL. It was honestly just a very fun experience overall.
> 
> Except when we thought we finished the showcase entirely at 4am, when I personally had to go away to take my train for COE too, then we ended up realizing the overall mappool showcase video trolled us, with lore having had to be re-rendered twice, some gameplay being at 30FPS for no understandable reason, and TaikoMom then having to re-render all of that while I was gone, and needing to ensure we would actually have the correct video by uploading it on: MEGA / Google Drive / an USB key / Her Switch's SD card.
> 
> Absolutely no stress whatsoever in that experience, of course, apparent by the fact that even on the very last Sunday before July 31st, we had no clue if any of this would even be done by the time we had to be at COE, honestly.
> 
> Still loved it! Glad we've done what we did honestly.

<!--
- GTS has grown more ambitious with originals each year, quickly attaining the highest volume of music production on osu!. What are your thoughts for the future of GTS?

Well, personally, it's a hard question to tackle. As we're currently in the midst of a break from hosting tournaments during the entirety of 2024, and preparing for EGTS' 2025 edition, I don't really know what else we could do.
We've done some of the best tournaments in the scene ever since 2018, have released so much original music to the point it's absurd, did the first ever taiko LAN tournament, and at the same time, the first ever tournament to be 100% original.
On top of that, we somehow manage to release yearly compilation albums, and also announce collaborations with other rhythm games for EGTS 2025.
So far, every year after EGTS was done, I always wanted to take a break, but ended up not doing so because I felt like we missed some opportunities. After 2021, I thought we could go for all tiebreakers being custom, so we did. After 2022, we originally had a collaboration with Phigros that should have happened then, so we went back to working on it, and announcing it back in October.
Quite frankly though myself, I will be quitting tournament hosting after EGTS 2025 is done, or, if we can do it again that year, COEGTS.
I think GTS tournaments will stop doing as much original music after either of these projects are done, as general exhaustion is creeping up, whether it is from the side of us admins, or designers and composers.
I think our tournaments will keep being the best thing we ever possibly can release, but one thing I hope GTS can do in the coming years, is to keep being more known for its name, and outside of the context of osu! at all.
Nonetheless, there's a lot to be done. We're just hoping it can keep going for a while. I think GTS as a tournament series still has a lot of years to go. I personally expect it to keep going until its 10th anniversary at the very least, being on 2028. Especially since we barely had just started doing a mapping contest as well in 2023, so I think other admins will have even more ideas to bring to the table in future years. Look forward to it.

> There are so many moments in music journey which reminded me that my life has meanings. Some other people would tell me directly that my compositions are emotionally touching to them, like *Akatsuki*, or *Essence*, or some actually perceived them as "insane". Especially if those are meant to be portraying my emotions at the time I was composing them, I would feel grateful a lot. It feels like somebody understood me and my intent of doing my best in my own hobby.
> 
> The most significant ones would be *Essence*, which I considered one of the significant moments of my life at that time. It was the biggest and the most emotional project we have ever done. I cannot stop going back and watch the reactions of the viewers at that time to the reveal of the tiebreaker song... It was both insane and emotional, and was the conclusion of the most productive session I've done at that time.

<!--
> 
> The other one which probably less or more related which is osu!mania LN Tournament 3, I also did more than 10 custom maps for that tournament, including the custom song "LNCryption", which was actually the space for the mappers to write and imagine the "hell" they faced somewhere else. It probably is worth to give them a read.
> I would also give an honorable mention to rememberance; image of him before departure from Vietnamese National osu!mania Cup, which I composed in one day, during one of my depressive episodes. It was meant to be something that is lighthearted and healing me up. Quick compositions like this can also help me coping through hard times as well.

## Not just music

**Jerry** had this to say about the various other media that goes into song production.

> The designing part of the process is usually carried out after the song is done, as it is alot easier to visualize the look of the song that way. As for the coordination work, we have a bit of a mini-pipeline process involving character artists (shoutouts to [HiroChair](https://twitter.com/HiroChair)), graphic designers (shoutouts to [Iyouka](https://twitter.com/iyouka_)) and video editors. The completed character artworks are passed over to the design team to do their magic on both the jacket artwork and osu! beatmap background for the song.
> 
> Similar to the composer's channel, the designers can also easily share their ideas with each other in the project, making it very much a collaborative effort. In tandem to all of this, a ~30 second intro video will also be made to properly showcase the original track during the mappool showcase livestream as well as on social media. All of these come together in a nice visual package that not just helps in elevating the tournament experience, but also effectively promotes the works of the amazing artists involved as well.

- The COEGTS song reveals included interesting pieces of lore. What was the story behind those?

<div align="center">
    <iframe width="95%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0I3UH7Al-lM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

> Well, COEGTS' lore is definitely an interesting story to tackle. For us co-hosts, it's definitely not the part of COEGTS that we're happy with, for sure. TaikoMom herself is very much not happy with it, with the fact that she basically had to take over the entire construction of it on July 27th, and had to write it from scratch in like two days, with multiple different characters already made, promised backgrounds that did not come to fruition, all over the place, as well as the general storyboard being quite barebones in the state she had it in.
> 
> The general gist of the story itself is a fairly classic story, attempting to tie things up as much as we could from past lore done in EGTS in 2021 and 2022, being a direct follow-up to the events for EGTS 2021's Grand Finals TB, with the old hero having "killed" the god representing that song, which was Kamelie. That same god instead woke up on Earth, with much less power, and their memories all gone, having woken up in Germany, and started to roam the Earth around the 1500s. Someone, who is still an unknown character to this day, found her, and decided to call her Tsubaki, as a meaning for a flower with no scent, and a woman with no past. Over time, she found a way to cross over to another world, but despite going on Earth, and Myosotis (The other world's name), she couldn't find anyone who recognized her.
> 
> She thought of herself as human, but wouldn't age, despite hundreds of years passing by. She ended up taking a lot of various jobs, and saving up so much money that she's become rich as hell.
> 
> She also became attuned to Myosotis and its boundary with Earth, and due to that, she ended up sensing it when Naru crossed over into Myosotis, and read the book about EGTS 2021's story. Tsubaki then decides to travel to that library in Japan, and also finds that book. While that happens though, the book has arrived to the time of EGTS 2022, and as Tsubaki arrives in that library, she feels a spark coming from the Netherlands, but she also finds Naru and Scarlett in that library. From then on, she realizes their strength, and decides to go on a journey with them towards that spark she felt, in Den Bosch, where she will end up facing her own self, once again.
> 
> It's quite the story, that goes a bit all over the place, I would definitely recommend watching the video compiling all of it to understand it better, though.
> But it feels a lot like a missed opportunity, because visually it looks very good, but we don't feel like it's that substantial of a story in the end, and especially considering the fact that, technically, out of all main mappool songs, ONE single song was pretty relevant to the lore itself.
> 
> And it somehow ended up being Obama Dive, so really, what the hell.
> 
> On top of that, one of the fight scenes, with the girls facing off against Garnie, one of the main antagonists, was originally sketched by our artist to have a big shrimp in the CG for it.
> That was not there, so quite frankly it was all gonna be downhill from there, 0/20 experience!!!
> 
> But yeah, having had to create all of that within two days, with the songs not having been made with any story in mind, makes it that it was kind of doomed to not be good enough.
> It was a cool experience nonetheless, but need to improve it a LOT, if we ever want to do it again.
> 
> By the words of my co-host TaikoMom on COE's stage after COEGTS ending, "I have a headache now :D".

- Apart from the music composition side, what goes into coordinating art, video or other media that make up the final presentation? (kasumi)

There is no coordination whatsoever, only stupidity.
In terms of overseeing who works on each song, that role generally goes to myself for all custom songs so far.
As we've gotten a lot of songs nowadays though, it's just become a fairly stream-lined process, of myself pinging all designers whenever a song gets composed enough to the point that a designer can get a good idea of the vibe he wants to give in the song's artwork. On that end, we very nearly don't give the designers any directions anymore, as they've worked on enough songs for us to like the work they produce anyway, so we keep it more simple that way.
90% of the time, it's just about which designer wants to make the artwork for it first, and that's about it. Sometimes they do claim things for themselves, or we make requests for specific designers to work on a song, but that's usually for our tournaments where there is only one song, and so we ask the main designer for the tournament to work on it.
In terms of video reveals, either the designer can do video work on his own as well, and so he does both. Those generally end up being "fairly" simple 30 seconds BGA, based on the main artwork, to introduce the song and artist in a more hype way than just throwing the map at people like any old map during showcases.
There are also storyboarders, but those are much, much more unusual, and it's less streamlined, and more, "welcome to hell you'll probably have less than a week to work on storyboard because artwork will be done then", so it's only been two people ever who have worked with us in past GTS storyboards while not being a GTS designer, especially Slyk, who had done the entire storyboard for 《/nttld.:beings》 within a week, despite being gone for three days inside that very week, and having done an amazing job.
It's very hard to explain the entire process, as it varies so much, but I think a good way to summarize it is: It's a mess, but we always make it work somehow.


## The beginnings

What about before 2020, before this crazy musical explosion happened? There are a lot more stories to be told. For example: we're not sure if you have noticed, but osu! does actually have what you could call an "original soundtrack".

-->

---

For the love of rhythm and music, new creations aborn. We're privileged to have so many with the stubborn passion to go above and beyond to make the osu! community something entirely our own.
