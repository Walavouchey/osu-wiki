The United States, persevering after many podium finishes, manage for the first time in their history to win the osu!catch World Cup. They were the favourites coming into this tournament, and tore through their bracket to reach the Grand Finals with only a single map lost, and in the end, no one could stop them. It's only the fourth different country to win this tournament, after Chile, South Korea, and China, so it is a big day for our game mode.

## Summary

![](/wiki/Tournaments/CWC/2024/img/cwc2024-podium.jpg)

Congratulations to the United States for their historic first osu!catch World Cup victory, and congratulations to Argentina and Poland on their podium finishes.

The United States have been the "challengers" for years at this point, but were never the favourites to win it all against China and South Korea. They were however, always a top 6 contender and more often even 2nd and 3rd. With a lot of their core members remaining the same over the years, it is truly a special moment for them to finally become champions, after so many closes finishes.

We also have an (almost) entirely new podium this year, with Poland making their first appearance up there, along with Argentina who hadn't made top 3 since 2013. Both of these teams have had their best run ever this tournament, and thanks to their hard work and dedication, they finally reached the podium. A lot of new talent is stepping up, and this result reflects it.

## Grand Finals recap

### ::{ flag=US }:: United States vs. ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina

This match was a repeat of the winners' bracket final, but it was different. In the Finals week, the United States won very convincingly 7–1 against Argentina — it was their first map loss of the tournament, but also their only this match. However, coming into this, Argentina was determined to make things different. The current roster for Argentina is known to be especially good on difficult mappools, and has the highest potential to match the United States' scaling. Every round, they got stronger, and it definitely did happen again in the Grand Finals.

They went on to win 7–4 against Poland to reach the Grand Finals, and they already accomplished something they dreamed of — make top 2 in CWC. It was a first for them, but... couldn't they push further?

The United States stood in their way, being the team that absolutely dominated the entire tournament, and bested them the week prior. This year, they weren't challenging the favourites to win, they *were* the favourites, and of course, they wouldn't let this opportunity go to waste. Their core players have been playing the osu!catch World Cup for the past five (or more!) years in a row, hoping to finally win it all, and they were clearly not going to let the Argentinians get their first win before them.

Argentina opened with [NM4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1749081#fruits/3577912), but the United States would win it and get a breakpoint right away, setting the tone for the match to come. They then secured it by winning their next two picks in [NM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202783#fruits/4662225) and [DT3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202812#fruits/4662283), showing off their versatility on wildly different maps. This versatility is really what would give them an edge in this match, having a very deep roster able to fill every niche imaginable. Argentina on the other hand, is a roster who mainly relies on their core three, playing almost every single map, every match. This weakness would really start to hurt them against an opponent such as the United States.

They still managed to stay in the match though, also winning their next two picks, [MM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202817#fruits/4662289) and [MM3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202818#fruits/4662291). The score was now 3–2 for the United States on their own pick, and for the first time this tournament, they were truly challenged by their opponent. They went on to pick [DT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202815#fruits/4662287) and win it, and Argentina opted for [HR1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202800#fruits/4662258). This would unfortunately backfire, allowing the United States to get a second breakpoint. Still as strong as ever, they wouldn't let go of them once secured, as they were still undefeated on their own picks. It would be the same for [HR2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202816#fruits/4662288), which put them at a 6–2 lead.

The match was starting to slip away from the Argentinians' hands, and they had to do something if they wanted to stay in it. Their choice would end up being [HD3](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202858#fruits/4662378), on which we saw the first and only FC of the week, with a mind-blowing SS from ::{ flag=AR }:: [-Story-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8172283). This would seemingly give them the momentum they needed to keep on going, because they ended up taking a breakpoint away from the United States, being the only team to do so in the tournament, on a very close [HD2](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202810#fruits/4662280). Unfortunately, having exhausted most of their good options, the match would end on their next pick, [NM1](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2202779#fruits/4662219), on which the United States prevailed once again.

And this is how this *story* (hehe) concludes, with an historic finish for both of these teams. While the United States may have won in the end, what Argentina accomplished this year is also a victory in its own right, and the same can be said for Poland. History has been made for all the podium finishers, making this osu!catch World Cup truly a special one.

        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            The process is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul class="osu-md__list">
            <li class="osu-md__list-item">We write a list of artists based on desired genre and focus on having a wide spread of diverse songs</li>
            <li class="osu-md__list-item">mangomizer reaches out to artists over the course of several weeks</li>
            <li class="osu-md__list-item">When artists respond, we send some specifications and suggestions, though the artist has full agency over the song</li>
            <li class="osu-md__list-item">A Discord channel is created where artists can send works in progress, where organisers and you advisors can send feedback</li>
            <li class="osu-md__list-item">Production goes on for months until the due date, which is around when the song is expected to be showcased </li>
            <li class="osu-md__list-item">While the production process is underway, we start thinking of potential rounds and slots to place the map in, once we hear enough of the song.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            We typically aim for a relatively even spread of originals across all rounds, slightly leaning towards the mid-to-lategame rounds - this is done in an attempt to reward players for reaching so far in the tournament bracket, while also trying to maximize the amount of teams who get to play the map in the tournament.
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            Other advisors may have different philosophies for how and where they want to place their originals, however, and it really comes down to the songs we end up receiving.

            Moving on to mapping then, I wonder about the intricacies of handling mappools and custom maps. Are there general or distinct examples of the kinds of projects that go smoothly or ones that do not, projects you involve yourself more in, or moments where you've felt you've been able take a more hands-off approach?

            Mapping, requires the most management and can definitely be quite chaotic. Similarly to last year, we went for an entirely custom pool so there were MANY maps to be made.
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            Because of this high workload, the biggest issue is essentially getting finished by the deadline. It can lead to a very chaotic experience attempting to mod the maps to the best of your ability before showcase. While some maps may require less attention, its always worth checking every map in order to improve the experience as much as possible. We hope to lower the workload for next year to reduce the chaos though :')
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            As for a hands-off approach, for me, my biggest example of that was listening to the songs as much as I possibly could in my spare time. For Psychology of James Berland (Ro16 TB) I bought the album cd "Culprate Number Four" and would listen to it everyday from and to work. Even listening too it on my breaks to generate more patterning ideas.
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            While this might seem silly, every map that makes up the tournament has the opportunity to be special and provide players with an unforgettable experience. I feel many mappers (me included) attempt to facilitate that.

            Two things to add:
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            In addition to the high volume of custom maps, another reason why it can become so chaotic is because many mapping signups are done within a narrow timespan. When it comes to signups, mappers can either approach us with a desired slot and/or song in mind, or the mappoolers can reach out to certain mappers to assign them a slot that we think will fit their mapping style.
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            We opened signups several months before TWC even started - but a couple of weeks after signups started, over half of all the slots were taken already! It definitely becomes a bit of a juggling act to try and balance mapping styles and map difficulty, especially in the following weeks when the half-completed WIPs come flooding in.
        </p>
        <p class="osu-md__paragraph">
            We also try to encourage mappers to map songs from the Featured Artist listing, in an attempt to further promote the featured artists' works under the official osu! channels. We try to roughly aim for a 50% FA usage rate for each round of the tournament, but this year, almost 70% of all of the songs used came from the listing! We'll do our best to match that next year.

            I create music primarily for myself, so there is no message intended for anyone else. "illloved" was simply released as a result of negative emotions that had matured within me over many years and couldn't be fully expressed in words. However, there may have been a feeling that I couldn't bear to die holding onto these emotions alone.

            The song itself took nearly two years to produce. From there, we developed the idea for the music video and commissioned several drawings from an illustrator based on that idea. In between deliveries I was mixing and mastering. This took a total of nearly six months. Finally, the music video was completed after a month and a half of production in After Effects.

This osu!catch World cup was a special one thanks to every one who helped and gave some of their time to make it a memorable experience, without forgetting the players who competed during these couple of weeks.

This was also a fun event thanks to everyone who tuned in to the streams and followed the matches, whether it was to support your own country or just as an osu!catch enjoyer. And if you're here, thanks as well for reading these weekly recaps!
