New year! New osu!, right? Catch up with all that's changed since last year!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2023-02-01-osumonthly-7/banner.jpg)

Welcome to the 7th edition of osu!monthly! It is hard to believe that it has been 7 editions, 7 months for writing for the community. While the new year brings in new changes and more excitement for the upcoming year know that if it happens in osu!, we've got it covered, though we cannot always cover everything and are always looking for content curators, writers, and osu! enthusiasts to come and help out. If you are interested or have feedback don't be shy and let us know in the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy).

The osu!monthly [forum post](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1614314?n=1) has somewhat been disbanded after a lengthy discussion in how to reduce bloat and improve readability of the newsletter, it has now been since transformed into a permanent [osu! wiki page](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/People/osu%21monthly_team) listing the "osu!monthly team" that'll be used to sign the newsletter, but don't fret, all contributors are welcome and encouraged to help.

If you'd like to look at the previous editions of osu!monthly then make sure to check out the [wiki page](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Community/osu%21monthly) that lists not only this revival, but all other editions of the infamous project.

Now that we have rambled on and on, let's check out what January had in store for us!
