2022 has been a good year for the skinning community, with a lot of positive changes being brought upon the community and the systems that keep it flourishing! Before we kick off with the voting details, we should look back at what happened in 2022 within the skinning community, including (but not limited to) the [compendium](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/) changes:

## Year in review: 2022

### Contests

2022 saw 2 official skinning contests this year, [Tides of Winter](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/2) and [Chromatic Alteration](/wiki/Contests/Skinning_Contest/3) which in total had **40** different entries by various artists, all trying their best to win the coveted profile badges, along with some osu!supporter tags. If you are interested in seeing all the 40 entries, you can do so [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/137) and [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/148).

### Compendium changes

The compendium has seen a lot of positive changes this year, such as:

- A report button being implemented for skin issues
- Submissions have been moved from a forum post to a Google form
- New tag displays have been added for ease of search
- [Skinners' bulletin](https://compendium.skinship.xyz/bulletin) has been added, showcasing hand-picked skins every month
- New filter options have been added to the website (release date & date skin was added to compendium)

Next to changes to the website itself, the staff behind it has also changed with [_mikansei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13140446) leaving the team, and [XetThe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16274977) taking their place to further assist the compendium team.

### Forums

A new [Remixed Skins](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/124) subforum has been created around November 2022 with the aim of hosting all skins that have not been made from scratch by the creators, with the aim of removing bloat from the skinning forums and allowing original skins to have their own place in the forums. This new subforum allows for posting of said skins with the caveat that proper credits are required. Original creators are of course still able to make use of their rights and file DMCA claims if they have an issue with their elements being used in a skin.

### Other

The skinners' bulletin has made a come back in December 2022, now being a part of [osu!monthly](/wiki/Community/osu!monthly), with the [skinship team](https://skinship.xyz/) curating the best skins submitted each month.  As mentioned above as part of the compendium changes, the skins that get picked by the team are added to the skinner's bulletin and get their own special tag.

## Voting details

All skins that have been submitted to the compendium during 2022 are eligible to compete, **including contest & podium entries**. The top voted entry will receive a unique profile badge based on their entry and 3 months of osu!supporter. Entries #2 - #10 will receive 1 month of osu!supporter.

You will be cast your vote for **X days** after this post goes up, with the votes closing on **date here**, hopefully that's enough time to go through the catalogue and pick your favourites!
