[NPC 2025 kicked off back in January.](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-01-29-newspaper-cup-2025) It was originally a Chinese mapping contest to promote novice mappers, which had its first iteration in 2015. Through the past years, the Newspaper Cup has become a renowned contest for encouraging fresh bloods into mapping and finding new talents across the entire mapping community. This year, NPC has made a creative step that allows the participant to choose from any track they like from the [featured artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) library. With a total of 79 entries across three tracks, it makes NPC 2025 one of, if not the most exciting, community mapping contests for new mappers ever!

Today let's take a deeper look at the winning entries, and check out what the judges would like to comment about them!

### 1st Place: [Camellia - Dance with Silence](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374180) (mapped by [PEALEERD_TAK](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6214002))

Pata-Mon:
> 相当有表现力的一张图，对滑条的运用较为合适，且flow也很好，打起来比较舒服。(This is a map that expresses the music very well. The mapper managed to use the sliders in a fairly solid way. The map has nice flow and good playability too.)

-kevincela-:
> I feel it's pretty fitting for the song overall. Patterns are fire and very well reasoned, and this is one of my favorite entry.

### 2nd Place: [Eisyo-kobu - Faithtival](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374192) (mapped by [Mimosa M](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/24010320))

Dada:
> Extremely impressive entry with technically superb visuals and supremely consistent ideas and structure. This sort of map has been done (09kami, yf_bmp and a couple other entries in this contest) before but I feel some of the patterning explored here pushed it even further beyond the existing ideas. Great job!

Pata-Mon:
> 好！(Great!)

### 3rd Place: [Aethoro - Deertracks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374121) (mapped by [-YeLing-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14726718))

Luval:
> Did very well in reflecting music elements, love the dense visual for the first half of the map and most patterns matched the music well, good work.

-kevincela-:
> Very cool map! I enjoy your kickslider usage for emphasis, and the entry in general is very clean looking. I really like how the map also changes style and uses different ideas throughout the song.

A side note that -YeLing- participated and winned the screener's pick at the [May 2025 Monthly Beatmapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2025-05-12-monthly-beatmapping-contest-may-2025) with the same song but in a quite different style. Both of the maps are amazing, so please do check [the other map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374132) out!

### 4th Place: [Ludicin - Signal](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374038) (mapped by [JukedEm](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17387300))

Satellite:
> I think it's very good, with many patterns that match, such as being particular about the details, using symmetry, and combining shapes.

Alty:
> Good map, don't have much to say about it.

### 5th Place: [linear ring - enchanted love](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2374228) (mapped by [Phten02](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16678364))

Dada:
> Very interesting map! A great example of how to make a messy structure work even if I think it was a bit too messy especially with slider design at points. Also a very technically challenging song to map and you did a great job at rising up to that challenge.

Luval:
> Pretty outstanding design among all entries, flow is good and visual style is clean I like it, can see this mapper is experienced.
